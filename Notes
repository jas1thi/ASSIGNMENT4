Description:

Now that you have a working menu page, Assignment 4 requires you to implement a backend to handle the interactive order form. Using Node.js and Express, you will set up a basic server to manage POST and GET requests.
This involves processing form data to calculate the total amount of an order upon submission and serving your order confirmation web page.

Note: If the calculation of the total amount has previously been implemented on the frontend, you are required to shift this functionality to the backend. 

Make sure the server-side logic is robust and functional!
